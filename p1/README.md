# Project 1 - Scanner
> Note: program implemented using FSA table and driver.

We will be implementing a scanner for the provided lexical definitions. The scanner is embedded and thus it will return one token every time it is called. Since the parser is not available yet, we will use a tester program to call the scanner. 

#### Scanner Type (the scanner could be implemented as follows)
1. Plain string reader – read strings separated by spaces – (70 points) 
    * All tokens must be separated by spaces
    * Lines may not be counted (75 points if counted) 
    * Comments may be without spaces (will be tested without spaces in this option) 
2. Module generated by LEX (75 points)
3. FSA table + driver (100 points) &larr; **SELECTED**

##

#### Impementation:
* Implement a token as a triplet {tokenID, tokenInstance, lineNumber} (*if option with line numbers)
* Implement the scanner in a separate file with basename “scanner” 
* For testing purposes, the scanner will be tested using a testing driver implemented in file with basename “testScanner”. You need to implement your own tester and include as a part of the project. 
* This tester will ask the scanner for one token at a time and display the token to the screen, one per line, including information (descriptive) on what token class, what token instance, and what line, if applicable. 

#### Invocation: 
```
    scanner [file]
```
* To read from stdin or file file.sp2020 
* Arguments are the same as P0

#### Lexical Definitions
1. Your language is case sensitive 
2. Each scanner error should display “SCANNER ERROR:” followed by details such as the line number (if you keep track of line number) 
3. Alphabet: 
    * All English letters (upper and lower), digits, plus extra characters below and WS 
    * No other characters allowed and they should generate errors 
4. Identifiers: 
    * They must begin with an UPPER case or lower case letter and...
    * Continue with any number of letters and digits 
    * Assume that no identifier is longer than 8 characters in testing 
5. Keywords (reserved, a good idea to have individual tokens) 
    * label | goto | loop | void | declare | return | in | out | program | iffy | then | assign | data 
6. Operators and delimiters group (all single character except for := and ==) [19 totals]
    * Comparison (Relational) Operators&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; := == : < >
        * colonEqual, equalEqual, colon, lessThan, greaterThan, 
    * Arithmetic Operators&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + - * / %
        * plus, minus, multiply, divide, modulus
    * Delimiter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . , ; ( ) { } [ ] 
        * dot, comma, semicolon, leftParen, rightParen, leftCurly, rightCurly, leftBracket, rightBracket
7. Integers 
    * Any sequence of decimal digits with no sign and no decimal point 
    * You may assume no number longer than 8 characters in testing 
8. Comments start with # and end with #
