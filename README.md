# Program Translation Techniques

#### Description:
> This course focuses on methods, techniques, and mechanisms used to bridge the abstraction from high level programming to machine level execution. This course also focuses on developing a complex individual project incrementally in separate modules tested and integrated.


#### Topics:
> The course will have a semester long project to build a working compiler, translating from some subset of a modern programming language into a simple assembly or machine language with available virtual machine for execution. One of the main objectives is to build a working product from incrementally built and independently tested modules. The sequences of topics will be as follows:
- Programming standards: source and architecture
- Introduction to languages 
- Translation models
- Lexical analysis
- Introduction to context free grammars
- Top down parsing
- Semantics processing and code generation


#### Assignments:
- Programming Refreshment
- Scanner
- Parser
- Static Semantics
- Code Generation
